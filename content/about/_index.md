> ### **WELCOME, I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU HERE!**

**I’m an Eindhoven-based Yoga Instructor (RYT500) with a dream to be happy, healthy, and young.**

A big part of this journey takes YOGA practice.

I Hope, you are on the same vibrations and I can help you in your journey (and back ;)!

I realized looking back that my yoga story started actually when I found My teacher. Online, on Youtube.
